A small set of scripts I used to isolate clean spectrogram audio clips and images from FEZ Original Soundtrack.

## Usage
1. Get puzzlified and unpuzzlified versions of the soundtrack (as in, versions with spectrograms and without them). Former can be obtained from Steam or Disasterpeace's Bandcamp. Latter can be legally obtained from Humble Indie Bundle 11 or Qobuz audio distributor.
2. Set correct paths to both soundtracks in `config.json`
3. Run `main.py`. Tracks should be processed and outputs should be generated in the `output` directory.
